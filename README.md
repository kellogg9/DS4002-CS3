# DS4002 Prototyping - CS3, CASE STUDY: Leveraging CNNs to Differentiate COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal Cases
This repository is to store our data, scripts, and output for our project. All contributions are done by Vaibhav Jha, Nick Kellogg, and Megan Vander Wiele. 

## Repository Contents
- ### Software and platform (MAC OSX): For this project, data was downloaded from Mendeley Data. In terms of data analysis, Python was used and multiple packages such as numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, and sklearn. All of the data is stored in a sharepoint link that directs a user to a zipped file containing three folders of images.

#### Reproduction Results:
- To reproduce our reuslts, first ensure that you have Python installed with the necessary packages. Then open the link to the UVA Sharepoint page and download the zipped file of data. Download the edda_project3.py script to gather ideas on how to investigate the image data. Then, download the COVIDModelTraining.py to run the models on imaging data.
